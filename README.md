 There are two sliedrs: 
 
 1.  move.html - its not a web Componenet -but it works as expected!

 2. inside the slider folder - it is a web component -
            but i didnt mananged to make it move- it somewhy not update teh html /css inisde the template.
  But it does present on the screen as Web componenet with parametes
 for the slider , you need nodeJS server to avoide cross origin error
